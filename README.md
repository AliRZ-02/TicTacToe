# TicTacToe
- This is the first Milestone Project of the Python Bootcamp on Udemy taught by Jose Portilla. 
- It is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game with rudimentary graphics in the form of console output. 
- It accepts two players and their names, randomizes the starting order to give a fair chance to both competitors and it updates and prints the board based on validated user input. 
- The game provides the user with messages in the event of wins or ties and allows for the option to play again. 


### Motivation
- Milestone Project 1: 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla

## Getting Started
- To be able to play this game, run the tictactoe.py script on an IDE - I used the Pycharm IDE by JetBrains

## Installation
- Import the shuffle function from the random library for the player order swap to work

### Authors
- This game was developed by myself, [Ali Raza Zaidi](https://twitter.com/Ali_RZ02)

### Learning Process
- Although my expertise in Java allowed me to transition quite easily to programming in Python, there were several new things I learned while creating this game
- I learned Python-specific syntax like the def function, import function in Python, for loops in Python mong many others
- I became more familiar with dynamically-typed languages

### Acknowledgements
- Most of my learning came from the Udemy course on Python by [Jose Portilla](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp)
- Thanks to the [Python Team](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html) for their Python docs, which I used to help me understand try-excepts in Python
